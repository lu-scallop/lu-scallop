# About Lucas

I am a software developer with a lot of code to do!

I focus on .NET technologies and general backend development. 

Currently I am working on personal projects to show what I can do and enhance my development experience.

I am posting my projects and other insights of mine on my Linkedin account: www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-vieira-rocha
